# Procedural Generation of Maze with Unity 

This project aims to 
 
1. understand and analyze different procedural generation algorithms and choose one of the algorithms to generate a maze using Unity 
2. evaluate the complexity of the maze generated using AI agents, the search algorithms used for the AI agents used are Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) 

In this task, the Procedural Generation Algorithms is Hunt-and-Kill algorithm because it can generate perfect maze and low time complexity. More details about this task is stated in the maze_evaluation.pdf report.
